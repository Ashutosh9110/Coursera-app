.env file: it is file where we put all the secrets of our project (passwords, keys)
along with .env file, we also create .env.example file so that whosoever is setting the project in future, they can clearly see, how the our env file looks like.. and they can put their own secrets (passwords, keys)
How do we do that?
install npm i dotenv
put require("dotenv").config() at the top of index file
add all the keys to .env file and replace the keys with process.env.variablename
